regex-max-int.sh: skipped test: very expensive: disabled by default
This test is very expensive, so it is disabled by default.
To run it anyway, rerun make check with the RUN_VERY_EXPENSIVE_TESTS
environment variable set to yes.  E.g.,

  env RUN_VERY_EXPENSIVE_TESTS=yes make check

or use the shortcut target of the toplevel Makefile,

  make check-very-expensive

SKIP testsuite/regex-max-int.sh (exit status: 77)
