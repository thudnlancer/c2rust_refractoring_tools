// Note: In Rust, we don't have direct equivalents for C's inline functions
// and macros. The functionality would typically be implemented as traits
// or regular functions. Since this is just a header translation with no
// actual implementation, we'll provide a minimal stub.

/// SE_LABEL_INLINE equivalent - uses Rust's inline attribute
#[inline]
pub fn SE_LABEL_INLINE() {}

// The actual SELinux label functionality would need to be implemented
// using Rust's FFI to interact with the system's SELinux libraries,
// but that would require unsafe blocks. Since the original code is just
// including headers and defining an inline macro, this is the minimal
// safe Rust equivalent.
