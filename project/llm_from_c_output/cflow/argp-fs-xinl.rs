// Include the Rust equivalent of argp-fmtstream.h functionality here
// Note: In Rust, we would typically implement this as a module or struct
// rather than using header files like in C.

// The weak alias functionality is not directly translatable to Rust as it's
// a C-specific feature. In Rust, we would use traits or module organization
// to achieve similar functionality in a type-safe way.
