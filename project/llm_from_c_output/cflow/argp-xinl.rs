// Note: Rust doesn't have exact equivalents for C's extern inline or weak aliases
// The functionality would need to be implemented differently in Rust

// In Rust, we would typically use traits or regular functions instead of extern inline
// Weak aliases aren't directly supported in Rust, but similar functionality can be
// achieved through feature flags or conditional compilation

// The actual argp functionality would need to be implemented separately in Rust
// as it would require a different architecture due to Rust's ownership system
