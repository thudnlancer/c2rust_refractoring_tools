// Rust equivalent for C header includes and macro definitions
// Note: In Rust, we don't have direct equivalents for C header includes
// and macro definitions like in C. Instead, we use Rust's module system
// and configuration attributes.

// For config.h functionality, Rust typically uses features and cfg attributes
#[cfg(feature = "selinux")]
mod selinux {
    // For _GL_EXTERN_INLINE, Rust uses #[inline] attribute by default
    // SE_LABEL_INLINE would be represented by inline functions in Rust
    pub mod label {
        // SELinux label functionality would be implemented here
        // using safe Rust constructs
    }
}
