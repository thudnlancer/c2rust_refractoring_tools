// Equivalent Rust code for the provided C header includes
// Note: Rust does not have direct equivalents for C preprocessor directives like #include and #define
// The functionality would typically be provided by Rust modules and crates

// In Rust, external dependencies are managed via Cargo.toml
// The following would be added to Cargo.toml:
// [dependencies]
// some_crate = "version"  // Replace with actual crates providing equivalent functionality

// The actual Rust implementation would depend on what functionality
// was being imported from config.h and openat.h
// For the openat functionality, you might use the nix crate or similar

// Placeholder for the actual implementation
// This would need to be replaced with specific Rust code implementing
// the required functionality from the original C headers
