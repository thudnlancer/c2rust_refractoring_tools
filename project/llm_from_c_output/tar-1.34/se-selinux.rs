// Rust equivalent of SELinux configuration and inline definitions
// Note: In Rust, we don't have direct equivalents for C preprocessor macros
// and inline functions are handled differently by the compiler automatically.

// SELinux functionality would typically be provided by a crate like `libselinux-sys` for FFI
// or a pure Rust implementation if available. The following is a placeholder
// showing how such bindings might be structured in Rust.

    }

    // Rust doesn't have exact equivalents for C's inline functions
    // but we can use Rust's inherent inlining optimization
