// Rust equivalent for SELinux context handling
// Note: In Rust, we'll use the libselinux crate which provides safe bindings
// to SELinux functions. This is a placeholder for the actual implementation.

// The equivalent of config.h and feature flags in Rust would be handled by 
// Cargo.toml features and conditional compilation
#![allow(unused_imports)]

// In Rust, we don't need explicit inline declarations as the compiler
// handles optimization automatically. The equivalent of _GL_EXTERN_INLINE
// is Rust's default behavior for small functions.

// For SELinux context operations, we'd typically use a crate like:
// use libselinux::context::Context;
// But since this is just header inclusion in the C code, we'll leave it as is
