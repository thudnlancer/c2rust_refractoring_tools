// Note: Rust doesn't have exact equivalents for C's extern inline or weak aliases
// The following are approximations of the functionality

/// Equivalent to __argp_usage/argp_usage
pub fn argp_usage() {
    // Implementation would go here
}

/// Equivalent to __option_is_short/_option_is_short
pub fn option_is_short() -> bool {
    // Implementation would go here
    false
}

/// Equivalent to __option_is_end/_option_is_end
pub fn option_is_end() -> bool {
    // Implementation would go here
    false
}

// In Rust, we don't need weak aliases as we can directly expose the functions
// through the module system. The public functions above serve both roles.
