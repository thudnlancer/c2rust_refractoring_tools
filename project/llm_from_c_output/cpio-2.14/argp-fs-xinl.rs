// Rust doesn't have exact equivalents for C preprocessor directives,
// so we'll use Rust's module system and cfg attributes instead

mod argp_fs_ei {
    // Placeholder for _LIBC specific definitions
}

#[cfg(not(feature = "libc"))]
mod argp_fs_ei {
    // Placeholder for non-_LIBC definitions
}

// In Rust, optimization is controlled by compiler flags, not code definitions
// So we don't need to define __OPTIMIZE__

// Include the Rust equivalent of argp-fmtstream.h
// In Rust, this would typically be a module import
mod argp_fmtstream;

// The weak alias functionality isn't directly applicable in Rust
// Rust uses a different mechanism for symbol linking and visibility
// So we omit the weak alias section entirely

// Note: The actual implementation of the functions would need to be
// provided in the argp_fmtstream module with proper Rust safety guarantees
