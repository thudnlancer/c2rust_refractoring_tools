// Note: In Rust, we don't need to explicitly compile inline functions
// as Rust's compiler will automatically inline when appropriate.
// The equivalent functionality would be implemented as normal Rust functions
// or methods in a module.

// The GSL combination functionality would be implemented as a Rust module
// with proper error handling and safety guarantees.

// Since the original C code is just setting up compilation flags and includes,
// there's no direct Rust equivalent to translate. The actual implementation
// would be in separate Rust modules that provide combination functionality.

// Build-related functionality in Rust is typically handled by Cargo.toml
// rather than build.h files.
