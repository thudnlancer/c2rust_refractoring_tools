// Note: This is a conceptual translation as the original C code heavily relies on GSL and template macros
// which don't have direct 1:1 equivalents in Rust. The Rust ecosystem has alternatives like ndarray
// for matrix operations, but the exact functionality would need to be reimplemented.

// For complex number support
use num_complex::{Complex32, Complex64};

// For matrix operations, we'd typically use ndarray or similar crate
// use ndarray::{Array2, ArrayView2};

// The original C code uses template macros to generate code for different types.
// In Rust, we'd typically use generics or create separate implementations for each type.

// Here's a conceptual structure for how this might be organized in Rust:

mod prop {
    // Generic implementation for different numeric types
    pub trait NumericType: Clone + Sized {
        // Define required operations
    }

    // Implement for various types
    impl NumericType for f32 {}
    impl NumericType for f64 {}
    impl NumericType for Complex32 {}
    impl NumericType for Complex64 {}
    impl NumericType for i8 {}
    impl NumericType for i16 {}
    impl NumericType for i32 {}
    impl NumericType for i64 {}
    impl NumericType for u8 {}
    impl NumericType for u16 {}
    impl NumericType for u32 {}
    impl NumericType for u64 {}

    // Matrix propagation function would be implemented generically
    pub fn propagate<T: NumericType>(/* matrix parameters */) -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
        // Implementation using safe Rust matrix operations
        Ok(())
    }
}

// The original C code's template instantiations would be replaced by Rust's generic system
// or by implementing the functions for each concrete type as needed.

// Note: A complete translation would require knowing the exact functionality in prop_source.c
// and would likely use crates like:
// - num-complex for complex numbers
// - ndarray for matrix operations
// - anyhow/thiserror for error handling
