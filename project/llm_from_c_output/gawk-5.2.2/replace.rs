// Rust standard library provides equivalents for most of these functions
// No need for unsafe replacements in Rust

// System functions are already provided by Rust's std::process
// Memory operations are provided by Rust's std::ptr and std::mem
// String operations are provided by Rust's std::str and std::string
// Time functions are provided by Rust's std::time and chrono crate
// Networking functions are provided by Rust's std::net
// Environment functions are provided by Rust's std::env

// For functions not directly available in Rust std:
// - Use well-maintained crates instead of custom implementations
// - For example, libc crate for low-level operations when absolutely necessary

// Note: Rust's safety guarantees mean we don't need most of these replacements
// as the standard library provides safe alternatives

// The following modules would contain safe Rust implementations if needed
// but most can be replaced with standard Rust functionality

#[cfg(not(feature = "system"))]
mod system;

#[cfg(not(feature = "strcoll"))]
mod strcoll;

#[cfg(not(feature = "strsignal"))]
mod strsignal;

// Time-related functions would use chrono or time crates
#[cfg(not(feature = "tzset"))]
mod tzset;

#[cfg(not(feature = "mktime"))]
mod mktime;

#[cfg(not(feature = "timegm"))]
mod timegm;

// Networking functions
#[cfg(all(feature = "sockets", not(feature = "getaddrinfo")))]
mod getaddrinfo;

// Environment functions
#[cfg(not(feature = "setenv"))]
mod setenv;

// Sleep functions
#[cfg(not(feature = "usleep"))]
mod usleep;
