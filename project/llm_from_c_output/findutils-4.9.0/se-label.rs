// Note: In Rust, we don't have exact equivalents for C's configuration macros
// or inline directives. The functionality would typically be implemented
// through proper Rust modules and traits.

// The actual SELinux label functionality would need to be implemented
// using Rust's FFI to interact with the system's SELinux libraries,
// but that would require unsafe blocks. Since the original code is just
// header inclusions and macros, there's no direct safe Rust equivalent.

// For a complete implementation, you would need to:
// 1. Create bindings to the SELinux C library
// 2. Wrap unsafe operations in safe abstractions
// 3. Implement proper error handling
// 4. Manage resources using Rust's ownership system

// This placeholder maintains the structure but doesn't provide functionality
pub mod selinux {
    pub mod label {
        // Placeholder for SE_LABEL_INLINE equivalent
        pub use std::marker::PhantomData;
