// Note: In Rust, we don't directly translate C header includes.
// Instead, we'll use Rust's module system and any necessary crates.
// For SELinux functionality in Rust, you'd typically use the `libselinux-sys` crate
// or similar bindings, but since the original code just sets up some configuration,
// we'll keep this minimal.

// The original C code defines SE_SELINUX_INLINE as _GL_EXTERN_INLINE
// In Rust, we don't need this as Rust's inlining is handled differently
// through the #[inline] attribute

// No direct equivalent needed in Rust for the C configuration setup
