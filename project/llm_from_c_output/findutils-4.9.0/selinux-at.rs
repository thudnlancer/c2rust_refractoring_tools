/// These are the dir-fd-relative variants of the functions without the
/// "at" suffix. For example, getfileconat (AT_FDCWD, file, &c) is usually
/// equivalent to getfilecon (file, &c). The emulation is accomplished
/// by first attempting getfilecon ("/proc/self/fd/DIR_FD/FILE", &c).
/// Failing that, simulate it via save_cwd/fchdir/getfilecon/restore_cwd.
/// If either the save_cwd or the restore_cwd fails (relatively unlikely),
/// then give a diagnostic and exit nonzero.

/// dir-fd-relative getfilecon. Set *CON to the SELinux security context
/// of the file specified by DIR_FD and FILE and return the length of *CON.
/// DIR_FD and FILE are interpreted as for fstatat[*]. A non-NULL *CON
/// must be freed with freecon. Upon error, set *CON to NULL, set errno
/// and return -1.

// 1. Rust bindings to libselinux
// 2. Proper error handling with Rust's Result type
// 3. Memory safety through Rust's ownership system
// 4. Conversion between C and Rust string types
// 5. Handling of file descriptors and paths safely
