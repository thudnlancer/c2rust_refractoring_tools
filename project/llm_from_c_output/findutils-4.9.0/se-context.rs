// Note: In Rust, we don't directly translate C header includes.
// Instead, we would create proper Rust bindings or use existing crates.
// Since this is just a configuration header, we'll mark it as such.
// Actual SELinux functionality would require external bindings.

// The INLINE attribute is not needed in Rust as the compiler handles inlining automatically
