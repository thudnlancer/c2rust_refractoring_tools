(Deprecated, use\n  --shadow-exclude 'bounding_shaped' or\n  --shadow-exclude 'bounding_shaped && !rounded_corners' instead.)\n\n--detect-rounded-corners\n  Try to detect windows with rounded corners and don't consider\n  them shaped windows. Affects --shadow-ignore-shaped,\n  --unredir-if-possible, and possibly others. You need to turn this\n  on manually if you want to match against rounded_corners in\n  conditions.\n\n--detect-client-opacity\n  Detect _NET_WM_OPACITY on client windows, useful for window\n  managers not passing _NET_WM_OPACITY of client windows to frame\n  windows.\n\n--refresh-rate val\n  Specify refresh rate of the screen. If not specified or 0, compton\n  will try detecting this with X RandR extension.\n\n--vsync vsync-method\n  Set VSync method. There are (up to) 5 VSync methods currently\n  available:\n    none = No VSync\n    drm = VSync with DRM_IOCTL_WAIT_VBLANK. May only work on some\n      (DRI-based) drivers.\n    opengl = Try to VSync with SGI_video_sync OpenGL extension. Only\n      work on some drivers.\n    opengl-oml = Try to VSync with OML_sync_control OpenGL extension.\n      Only work on some drivers.\n    opengl-swc = Try to VSync with SGI_swap_control OpenGL extension.\n      Only work on some drivers. Works only with GLX backend.\n    opengl-mswc = Try to VSync with MESA_swap_control OpenGL\n      extension. Basically the same as opengl-swc above, except the\n      extension we use.\n\n--vsync-aggressive\n  Attempt to send painting request before VBlank and do XFlush()\n  during VBlank. This switch may be lifted out at any moment.\n\n--alpha-step val\n  X Render backend: Step for pregenerating alpha pictures. \n  0.01 - 1.0. Defaults to 0.03.\n\n--dbe\n  Enable DBE painting mode, intended to use with VSync to\n  (hopefully) eliminate tearing.\n\n--paint-on-overlay\n  Painting on X Composite overlay window.\n\n--sw-opti\n  Limit compton to repaint at most once every 1 / refresh_rate\n  second to boost performance.\n\n--use-ewmh-active-win\n  Use _NET_WM_ACTIVE_WINDOW on the root window to determine which\n  window is focused instead of using FocusIn/Out events.\n\n--respect-prop-shadow\n  Respect _COMPTON_SHADOW. This a prototype-level feature, which\n  you must not rely on.\n\n--unredir-if-possible\n  Unredirect all windows if a full-screen opaque window is\n  detected, to maximize performance for full-screen windows.\n\n--unredir-if-possible-delay ms\n  Delay before unredirecting the window, in milliseconds.\n  Defaults to 0.\n\n--unredir-if-possible-exclude condition\n  Conditions of windows that shouldn't be considered full-screen\n  for unredirecting screen.\n\n--focus-exclude condition\n  Specify a list of conditions of windows that should always be\n  considered focused.\n\n--inactive-dim-fixed\n  Use fixed inactive dim value.\n\n--detect-transient\n  Use WM_TRANSIENT_FOR to group windows, and consider windows in\n  the same group focused at the same time.\n\n--detect-client-leader\n  Use WM_CLIENT_LEADER to group windows, and consider windows in\n  the same group focused at the same time. WM_TRANSIENT_FOR has\n  higher priority if --detect-transient is enabled, too.\n\n--blur-background\n  Blur background of semi-transparent / ARGB windows. Bad in\n  performance. The switch name may change without prior\n  notifications.\n\n--blur-background-frame\n  Blur background of windows when the window frame is not opaque.\n  Implies --blur-background. Bad in performance. The switch name\n  may change.\n\n--blur-background-fixed\n  Use fixed blur strength instead of adjusting according to window\n  opacity.\n\n--blur-kern matrix\n  Specify the blur convolution kernel, with the following format:\n    WIDTH,HEIGHT,ELE1,ELE2,ELE3,ELE4,ELE5...\n  The element in the center must not be included, it will be forever\n  1.0 or changing based on opacity, depending on whether you have\n  --blur-background-fixed.\n  A 7x7 Gaussian blur kernel looks like:\n    --blur-kern '7,7,0.000003,0.000102,0.000849,0.001723,0.000849,0.000102,0.000003,0.000102,0.003494,0.029143,0.059106,0.029143,0.003494,0.000102,0.000849,0.029143,0.243117,0.493069,0.243117,0.029143,0.000849,0.001723,0.059106,0.493069,0.493069,0.059106,0.001723,0.000849,0.029143,0.243117,0.493069,0.243117,0.029143,0.000849,0.000102,0.003494,0.029143,0.059106,0.029143,0.003494,0.000102,0.000003,0.000102,0.000849,0.001723,0.000849,0.000102,0.000003'\n  Up to 4 blur kernels may be specified, separated with semicolon, for\n  multi-pass blur.\n  May also be one the predefined kernels: 3x3box (default), 5x5box,\n  7x7box, 3x3gaussian, 5x5gaussian, 7x7gaussian, 9x9gaussian,\n  11x11gaussian.\n\n--blur-background-exclude condition\n  Exclude conditions for background blur.\n\n--resize-damage integer\n  Resize damaged region by a specific number of pixels. A positive\n  value enlarges it while a negative one shrinks it. Useful for\n  fixing the line corruption issues of blur. May or may not\n  work with --glx-no-stencil. Shrinking doesn't function correctly.\n\n--invert-color-include condition\n  Specify a list of conditions of windows that should be painted with\n  inverted color. Resource-hogging, and is not well tested.\n\n--opacity-rule opacity:condition\n  Specify a list of opacity rules, in the format \"PERCENT:PATTERN\",\n  like '50:name *= \"Firefox\"'. compton-trans is recommended over\n  this. Note we do not distinguish 100% and unset, and we don't make\n  any guarantee about possible conflicts with other programs that set\n  _NET_WM_WINDOW_OPACITY on frame or client windows.\n\n--shadow-exclude-reg geometry\n  Specify a X geometry that describes the region in which shadow\n  should not be painted in, such as a dock window region.\n  Use --shadow-exclude-reg 'x10+0-0', for example, if the 10 pixels\n  on the bottom of the screen should not have shadows painted on.\n\n--xinerama-shadow-crop\n  Crop shadow of a window fully on a particular Xinerama screen to the\n  screen.\n\n--backend backend\n  Choose backend. Possible choices are xrender, glx, and\n  xr_glx_hybrid.\n\n--glx-no-stencil\n  GLX backend: Avoid using stencil buffer. Might cause issues\n  when rendering transparent content. My tests show a 15% performance\n  boost.\n\n--glx-copy-from-front\n  GLX backend: Copy unmodified regions from front buffer instead of\n  redrawing them all. My tests with nvidia-drivers show a 5% decrease\n  in performance when the whole screen is modified, but a 30% increase\n  when only 1/4 is. My tests on nouveau show terrible slowdown. Could\n  work with --glx-swap-method but not --glx-use-copysubbuffermesa.\n\n--glx-use-copysubbuffermesa\n  GLX backend: Use MESA_copy_sub_buffer to do partial screen update.\n  My tests on nouveau shows a 200% performance boost when only 1/4 of\n  the screen is updated. May break VSync and is not available on some\n  drivers. Overrides --glx-copy-from-front.\n\n--glx-no-rebind-pixmap\n  GLX backend: Avoid rebinding pixmap on window damage. Probably\n  could improve performance on rapid window content changes, but is\n  known to break things on some drivers (LLVMpipe, xf86-video-intel,\n  etc.).\n\n--glx-swap-method undefined/copy/exchange/3/4/5/6/buffer-age\n  GLX backend: GLX buffer swap method we assume. Could be\n  undefined (0), copy (1), exchange (2), 3-6, or buffer-age (-1).\n  \"undefined\" is the slowest and the safest, and the default value.\n  1 is fastest, but may fail on some drivers, 2-6 are gradually slower\n  but safer (6 is still faster than 0). -1 means auto-detect using\n  GLX_EXT_buffer_age, supported by some drivers. Useless with\n  --glx-use-copysubbuffermesa.\n\n--glx-use-gpushader4\n  GLX backend: Use GL_EXT_gpu_shader4 for some optimization on blur\n  GLSL code. My tests on GTX 670 show no noticeable effect.\n\n--xrender-sync\n  Attempt to synchronize client applications' draw calls with XSync(),\n  used on GLX backend to ensure up-to-date window content is painted.\n\n--xrender-sync-fence\n  Additionally use X Sync fence to sync clients' draw calls. Needed\n  on nvidia-drivers with GLX backend for some users.\n\n--glx-fshader-win shader\n  GLX backend: Use specified GLSL fragment shader for rendering window\n  contents.\n\n--force-win-blend\n  Force all windows to be painted with blending. Useful if you have a\n  --glx-fshader-win that could turn opaque pixels transparent.\n\n--dbus\n  Enable remote control via D-Bus. See the D-BUS API section in the\n  man page for more details.\n\n--benchmark cycles\n  Benchmark mode. Repeatedly paint until reaching the specified cycles.\n\n--benchmark-wid window-id\n  Specify window ID to repaint in benchmark mode. If omitted or is 0,\n  the whole screen is repainted.\n\0"
